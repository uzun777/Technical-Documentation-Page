        <p>
          Documentation has been always a neglected task in the software
          development life cycle. While developing applications, most of the
          software developing professionals including senior professionals tend
          to forget about documentation although everyone is aware about the
          difficulties that are faced during code maintenance application.
          Documentation is a very important aspect specially when developing
          large and very big applications involving a number of modules.
        </p>
        <p>
          When developing an application with C#, we can minimize the effort of
          making and maintaining the application documentation. As a C#
          application developer, it is common to give inline comments, these
          inline comments can be the source to generate a strong and more
          accurate documentation. Inline comments are the most important part of
          any code as they provide valuable information about the part of the
          code that is written. And most importantly it is written when the
          system is constructed. One of the wonderful features of the C#
          compiler is that it supports automatic creation of documentation using
          comments written in the code, the only distinction being that the
          documentation is produced in XML. Unlike other automated documentation
          provided by various programming languages, that generates HTML based
          documentation, C# produces in XML but there are tools available that
          take XML files as the input and produce HTML based documentation. As
          the C# stores all the comments in an XML file, users have the
          flexibility to develop excellent documentation from C#. Code comments,
          user manuals, developer manuals, test plans, and many other documents
          can be generated from a single source using XML tags.
        </p>
        <p>
          The process of generating an XML based documentation is done by adding
          comments to various parts of the code. The process can be described in
          the following manner:
        </p>
        <code>
          Source file (.cs) -> C# Compiler (csc.exe) -> XML Documentation
          (doc.xml) -> HTML/ Visual Studio Based Documentation
        </code>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="C#_Documentation_Example">
        <header>C# Documentation Example</header>
        <p>
          Let's take an example and then try to use the above information to get
          an automated documentation file. The above is a typical example of an
          application during the construction phase and then we struggle at the
          time of maintenance as to what the function or the class was supposed
          to do! Let's give some comments and do the needful.
        </p>
        <code>
          using System; using System.Data; namespace ExampleDocumentation { //
          // DocumentationClass: Is the class that will be used for explaining
          the // example of automated documentation // public class
          DocumentationClass { // // public DocumentationClass () : // Is the
          constructor used for DocumentationClass class // public
          DocumentationClass () { } // // public void DocumentationClassMethod:
          Is a void method // that does not return anything and takes no
          parameters. // It does the functionality of some addition and
          subtraction to // get the result // public void
          DocumentationClassMethod () { } } }
        </code>
        <p>
          As you can see above, now we have added some valuable comments that
          tend to have lots of value. Now to generate the documentation we can
          have the following command
        </p>
        <code>
          Microsoft.NET\Framework\v1.1.4322>csc csc DocumentationClass.cs
          /doc:doc.xml
        </code>
        <p>
          In the above, command /doc instructs the compiler to produce the
          documentation named doc.xml. And this will produce the following
          output:
        </p>
        <code>
          <?xml version="1.0"?>
          <doc>
            <assembly>
              <name> DocumentationClass</name>
            </assembly>
            <members>
              <member name="T:ExampleDocumentation.DocumentationClass">

              <member name="M:ExampleDocumentation.DocumentationClass.#ctor">

              <member
                name="M:ExampleDocumentation.DocumentationClass.DocumentationClassMethod"
              >
                public void DocumentationClassMethod: Is a void method that does
                not return anything // and takes no parameters. //It does the
                functionality of some addition and substation to get the result
              </member>

          Some of the constants are attached usually with the commented object,
          these are the ID's that are used to identify the type code and part.
          Usually these are categorised in the following manner:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>N denotes the Namespace</li>
          <li>
            T denotes Type, and includes class, Interface, struct, enum or
            delegates
          </li>
          <li>F denotes the fields of class</li>
          <li>P denotes the Property indexer or indexed property</li>
          <li>
            M denotes the Methods special methods constructor and
            operator(overloaded)
          </li>
          <li>E denotes Events</li>
          <li>
            ! denotes an error string that C# was unable to resolve some
            references
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="In-depth_of_C#_Documentation">
        <header>In-depth of C# Documentation</header>
        <p>
          Before we proceed in depth about the automated documentation part,
          let's see some of the important aspects that are required to be known
          when developing the XML based documentation. The main point is that
          the comments needs to start with "//" as this is the way in which the
          compiler identifies tags for XML based documentation. "//" way of
          comments are also supported in C# but in general, the compiler ignores
          anything that is put after this, but when the compiler encounters
          another "/" then this indicates that this is an XML comment and needs
          to be handled properly. Usually the three slashes are followed by the
          XML tag, this contains the property and value along with it as needed.
          For example:
        </p>
        <code>
          // // this is a place where something is done //
        </code>
        <p>
          There are various predefined tags that are available for the purpose
          of generating the document. The developer has the freedom to use any
          type of XML tags to document the code, only thing is that these tags
          need to adhere to the XML syntax. The predefined tag indicates the
          type of documentary information that is being given, and the compiler
          validates these tags against certain aspects of these and produces the
          output. Other elements are used for the layout and/or formatting
          purpose. The C# compiler takes these comments embedded inside the XML
          tags and builds the XML based documentation. It generates errors when
          a false reference is encountered.
        </p>

        <p>
          The automated documentation in C# has some flaws; following are some
          of them that need to be taken into consideration:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            If in any case if you have forgotten to mention any comments for any
            method, it will just be ignored
          </li>
          <li>
            Even if the comments are written and you have written "//" instead
            of "//" then again the documentation will not have any reference of
            these comments
          </li>
          <li>
            While generating C# documentation whenever there is any kind of
            return type explicitly this has to be specified
          </li>
        </ol>
